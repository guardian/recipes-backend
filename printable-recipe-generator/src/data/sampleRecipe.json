	"description": "These are inspired by Moroccan maakouda, a fried potato street food snack. It’s usually stuffed into a sandwich with lots of harissa, although you can also serve it with yoghurt, to make it more kid-friendly. Serve warm or at room temperature: they won’t be as crisp once they’ve sat around for a bit, but they’ll still taste great",

Drain well, then, once they’re cool enough to handle, use a potato ricer to rice the potatoes into a large bowl (if you don’t have a ricer, use a masher).",
