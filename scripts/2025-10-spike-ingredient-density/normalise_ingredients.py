    We're trying to facilitate unit conversion in our database of recipes. For each ingredient I'll give you, I want you to normalise it to its simplest form, such that we can identify which density we need to gather.
    The normalised name should preserve the way the ingredient is shaped or cut as this has an impact on density, though there is no need to be extremely precise. "finely chopped" and "chopped" can be treated the same, for instance.
    For instance:
      - ripe mangoes -> mango
      - 1 garlic clove, peeled and finely chopped -> chopped garlic
      - 200g cherry tomatoes, halved -> cherry tomatoes
      - 1 small red onion, finely chopped -> chopped red onion
      - Leftover potato skins, ideally with a little flesh still left on â€“ aim for 1-2 skins per person -> potato skins
      - plain flour -> plain flour

    You'll receive a batch of ingredients, each with an id, a name, a prefix and a suffix.
    You'll respond with a JSON array of objects, each with the following fields:
      - ingredient_id: the id of the ingredient
      - normalised_name: the normalised name of the ingredient, in lowercase, singular if possible
