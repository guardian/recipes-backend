# feast-models

This library is fully generated based on the json schema files present in the `schema` directory at the root of this repository.

No typescript file should be commited to git, the compilation phase should always generate the latest models based on the schema.

The `package.json` contains the pre-build script that will automatically generate the files here before each compilation.
